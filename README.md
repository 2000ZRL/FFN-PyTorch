# FFN-PyTorch
Reimplementation of Flood Filling Network based on Pytorch

In the summer of 2019, I was conducting summer research for three months in [Prof. Shuiwang Ji](http://people.tamu.edu/~sji/)'s lab, Texas A&M University. 
In the first month I finished reimplementing Flood-Filling Network by PyTorch. 
I also modify my codes to run FFN on multi-gpus (eight gpus at most) by DataParallelism. 
In addition, I wrote eval.py to evaluate the segmentation results automatically. And evaluation metrics can be seen [here](https://github.com/cremi/cremi_python). You should setup 'cremi' on your PC or server. Pay attention to that 'cremi' was written by Python2, so you should modify some codes.
In order to select the best model on validation dataset, I also wrote ckp_sel.py to do the job automatically.

How to get data? The data is so large that they are stored on Baidu Cloud. Here is the link.

How to put the data? After you get the training and test dataset, please unzip them and put them in FIB-25/train_sample and FIB-25/test_sample, respectively
If you put them somewhere else, you might need to modify the 'flags' in my scripts.

How to run the scripts? 
Before you train the model, please run partition.py and then build_coordinates.py in 'data'. What these two scripts do can be found in README.md of [original FFN](https://github.com/google/ffn). In fact, I have already done the preprocessing part and the result is coordinates_file.npy stored on Baidu Cloud. So you can ignore this step.

Run train.py. Before that please set Visdom on your server or just comment out the codes about 'eval_tracker'. One checkpoint is stored in 'checkpoints', although it might not be the best one.

Run inference.py

Run eval.py
